# The Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA) Github
We are the [Center for Effective Global Action (CEGA)](https://cega.berkeley.edu) at the University of California, Berkeley. CEGA works at the intersection of rigorous social science, data science, and policy and regularly partners with governments, researchers, and practitioners to generate evidence that improves lives in low- and middle-income countries. You’ve reached the __CEGA institutional GitHub__, which hosts (1) Open-source learning materials, (2) Code-based tools and packages for general use, and (3) Replication code for research projects developed by CEGA and our partners. 

Many repositories are designed for reuse and adaptation by __researchers, students, and public-sector teams__, and reflect CEGA’s commitment to openness, reproducibility, and policy relevance. If you would like to include your CEGA-supported work in the resources below, please reach out to our Communications Manager Eeman Abbasi (eemanabbasi[at]berkeley[dot]edu).

## Open-source Learning Materials
CEGA produces templates, digital textbooks, and workshops to democratize access to the skills needed to conduct rigorous social science research that can inform decision-making in low- and middle-income countries. You can explore many of our learning resources below; we encourage instructors to incorporate these into their courses.

## Code-based tools and packages
CEGA supports the general use of its code-based tools by other researchers and analysts working in the public sector and other social service providers. We encourage contributions via pull requests. If you have questions, you can contact the tool owner identified below.

## Replication code for research projects
Research project code must persist for replication purposes. It will not typically be updated following the publication of the corresponding research paper. We encourage faculty to incorporate replications of CEGA-supported studies into their methodology courses.
